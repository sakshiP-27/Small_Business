# CreditSense 💳

> Know your loan eligibility before you walk into a bank. Knowledge is leverage.

CreditSense is an AI-powered loan eligibility prediction web app. Enter your financial profile, and an XGBoost model trained on 160,000 real loan records tells you — in under 3 seconds — whether you'd be accepted or rejected, why, and what your credit score looks like.

## ✨ What it does

- Predicts loan acceptance / rejection with **98.67% accuracy**
- Returns a **credit score (300–850)**, default probability, and risk band
- Explains every factor — strengths and areas of concern — using SHAP values
- Beautiful multi-step form with field-level tooltips, validation, and smooth animations
- Full result page with glassmorphism metrics, animated score arc, and factor breakdown

## 🧠 The Model

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | XGBoost (binary:logistic) |
| Training samples | ~160,000 (80k accepted + 80k rejected) |
| Accuracy | **98.67%** |
| ROC-AUC | **0.9988** |
| Features | 10 (FICO scores, DTI, loan amount, employment stability, DTI buckets) |
| Explainability | SHAP TreeExplainer |

The model was trained exclusively on features present in **both** datasets to avoid data leakage. SHAP values drive the positive/negative factor explanations shown on the result page.

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- `uv` or `pip` for Python deps

### 1. Clone & set up Python env

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/creditsense.git
cd creditsense

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the model (first time only)

```bash
python ml/main.py
```

This reads `sme1.csv` and `sme2.csv`, trains the XGBoost model, and saves `ml/loan_model.pkl`.

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
venv/bin/python backend/app.py
# → Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → Running on http://localhost:5173
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you're live.
